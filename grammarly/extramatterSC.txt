The decay rate of the electroweak vacuum is studied in the standard model as well as in various models beyond the standard model. We use a state-of-the-art technique to calculate the decay rate of a false vacuum in gauge theory.  We present a detailed formula to calculate radiative corrections to the decay rate, which can be applied to any model that exhibits classical conformality at a high energy scale.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec_intro} \setcounter{equation}{0} 

In the standard model (SM) of particle physics, it has been known that the Higgs quartic coupling may become negative at a high scale through quantum corrections, so that the Higgs potential develops a deeper vacuum.  The detailed shape of the Higgs potential depends on the Higgs and top masses; with the recently observed Higgs mass of [expression], it has been known that the electroweak (EW) vacuum is not absolutely stable if the SM is valid up to [expression] or higher.\footnote {For the absolute stability of the EW vacuum in the standard model, see [citation].  } In such a case, the EW vacuum can decay into the deeper vacuum through tunneling in quantum field theory.  The lifetime of the EW vacuum has been one of the important topics in particle phenomenology and cosmology [citation].  In addition, the decay rate is highly sensitive to new particles that couple to the Higgs boson because of additional quantum corrections to the Higgs effective potential [citation]. It allows us to constrain models beyond the SM even when new particles are much heavier than the EW scale.\footnote {} 

The decay rate of the EW vacuum has been discussed for a long time. The calculation of the decay rate at the one-loop level first appeared in [citation], and was also discussed in other literature [citation].\footnote {For earlier works on the decay rate of the EW vacuum, see [citation].} However, there are subtleties in the treatment of zero modes related to the gauge symmetry breaking, which make it difficult to perform a precise and reliable calculation of the decay rate.  Recently, a prescription for the treatments of the gauge zero modes has been clarified [citation], based on which complete calculations for the SM case were carried out [citation]. 

The lifetime of a vacuum can be evaluated through a rate of bubble nucleation in unit volume and unit time as formulated in [citation].  The rate is expressed in the form of [equation], where [expression] is the action of a so-called bounce solution, and prefactor [expression] is essentially quantum corrections to [expression], having mass dimension 4.  Bounce solution is an [expression] symmetric solution of the Euclidean equations of motion, connecting the two vacua. In the SM, there are infinite number of bounce solutions owing to (i) the classical scale invariance at a high energy scale, (ii) the global symmetries corresponding to [expression], as well as (iii) the translational invariance.  It has been known that (iii) represents the infinite volume of spacetime, giving the mass dimension to [expression] [citation].  On the contrary, a proper procedure to take account of the effects of the zero-modes related to (i) and (ii) were not well understood until [citation].  Although the dominant suppression of the decay rate comes from [expression], the prefactor [expression] is also important. This is because of large quantum corrections from the top quarks and the gauge bosons. Thus, it is essential to calculate both [expression] and [expression] to determine the decay rate precisely.  In this paper, we calculate [expression] properly taking into account the effects of zero-modes, which gives a reliable estimation of the decay rate. 

We first present a detailed formulation of the calculation of the decay rate at the one-loop level. Each of the one-loop corrections is given in the form of a ratio of functional determinants.  We obtain a complete set of analytic formulae that can be used for any models that exhibit classical conformality at a high energy scale like the SM. Then, as one of the important applications, we calculate the decay rate of the EW vacuum in the SM. We find that the decay rate of the EW vacuum is much longer than the age of the universe. We also find that one-loop corrections from the top quark and the gauge bosons are very large although there is an accidental cancellation. It shows the importance of [expression] for the evaluation of a decay rate.  We also evaluate the decay rates of the EW vacuum for models with extra fermions which couples to the Higgs field.  In such models, the EW vacuum tends to be destabilized compared with that of the SM [citation] since the quartic coupling of the Higgs field is strongly driven into a negative value. We consider three cases where we have, in addition to the SM particles, (i) vector-like fermions having the same SM charges as left quark and down quark, [expression], (ii) vector-like fermions having the same SM charges as left lepton and electron, [expression], and (iii) a right-handed neutrino, [expression]. We give constraints on their couplings and masses, requiring that the lifetime of the EW vacuum is longer than the age of the universe. 

 

This paper is organized as follows. In section \ref{sec_formulation}, we outline the formulation for the decay rate at the one-loop level. The detail of the calculation is given in Appendices \ref{apx_determinantJ} [expression] \ref{apx_divpart}.  We provide analytic formulae for each particle that couples to the Higgs boson and discuss resummation of logarithmic terms using the renormalization group (RG). In section \ref{sec_SM}, we evaluate the vacuum decay rate in the SM. All the technical details are covered in this section. In section \ref{sec_extra}, we analyze decay rates in models with extra fermions. Finally, we conclude in section \ref{sec_conclusion}. 

\section{Formulation} \label{sec_formulation} \setcounter{equation}{0} 

We first discuss how we calculate the decay rate of the EW vacuum.  In the SM, the EW vacuum becomes unstable due to the RG running of the quartic coupling constant of the Higgs boson, which makes the quartic coupling constant negative at a high scale.  In the SM, the instability occurs when the Higgs amplitude becomes much larger than the EW scale.  Then, the typical size of the field value for the bounce configuration is much larger than the EW scale.  In such a case, we can safely neglect the quadratic term in the Higgs potential because the mass-squared parameter for the quartic term is around the EW scale. 

In this section, in order to discuss how the decay rate of the false vacuum in such a situation can be evaluated, we use a toy model with [expression] gauge symmetry to derive relevant formulas.  The calculation of the decay rate of the EW vacuum is almost parallel to that in the case with [expression] gauge symmetry; the application of the formulas to the case of the SM will be explained in the next section. 

\subsection{Set up} 

 

Let us first summarize the set up of our analysis.  We study the decay rate of a false vacuum whose instability is due to an RG running of the quartic coupling constant of a scalar field [expression].  We assume that [expression] is charged under the [expression] gauge symmetry (with charge [expression]); the kinetic term includes  [equation], where [expression] is the gauge field and [expression] is the gauge coupling constant, while the scalar potential is approximated as [equation]. [expression] depends on the renormalization scale [expression] and is assumed to become negative at a high scale due to the RG effect.  Notice that we neglect the mass-squared term in the scalar potential, assuming that [expression] becomes negative at a scale much higher than the mass parameter in the Lagrangian.  With the set up mentioned above, it is notable that the scalar potential has scale-invariance at the classical level.  In the application to the case of the SM, [expression] corresponds to the Higgs doublet and [expression] corresponds to the Higgs quartic coupling constant. 

Hereafter, we perform a detailed study of the effects of the fields coupled to the scalar field [expression] on the decay rate of the false vacuum.  We consider the Lagrangian which contains the following interaction terms: [equation], where [expression] is a real scalar field, and [expression] and [expression] are chiral fermions (with relevant [expression] charges).\footnote {We assume that there exist other chiral fermions which cancel out the gauge anomaly.} We take [expression] real, and [expression].  We neglect dimensionful parameters which are assumed to be much smaller than the typical scale of the bounce.  In addition, in order to take into account the effects of gauge-boson loops, gauge fixing is necessary.  Following [citation], we take the gauge fixing function of the following form: [equation]. Then, the gauge fixing term and the Lagrangian of the ghosts (denoted as [expression] and [expression]) are given by [equation], where [expression] is the gauge-fixing parameter.\footnote {In the non-Abelian case, one of [expression] in Eq.\ \eqref{L_FP} is replaced by the covariant derivative. The interaction of the ghosts with the gauge field does not affect the following discussion.} 

With our choice of the gauge fixing function, a global [expression] symmetry remains in the Lagrangian.  As a result, the bounce solution can be written in the following form: [equation], where [expression] is a real parameter.  The function [expression] obeys [equation], with boundary conditions [expression] and [expression].  For a negative [expression], we have a series of Fubini-Lipatov instanton solutions [citation]: [equation], which is parameterized by [expression] (i.e., the field value at the center of the bounce) and [equation]. The bounce action is given by [equation]. Notice that the bounce action is independent of [expression] owing to the scale invariance. 

Once the bounce solution is obtained, we may integrate over the fluctuation around it.  Around the bounce configuration with [expression], we may expand [equation], where [expression] and [expression] are physical Higgs mode and Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mode, respectively.  At the one-loop level, the prefactor can be decomposed as a product of the contributions of individual fields: [equation], where [expression] is the volume of spacetime, [expression] is the contribution from particle [expression].  Here, [expression] is the gauge field. Each of the factors has a form of [equation], where [expression] and [expression] are the fluctuation operators around the bounce solution and around the false vacuum, respectively.  Here, [expression] for Dirac fermions and Faddeev-Popov ghosts, and [expression] for the other bosonic fields.  The fluctuation operator is defined as second derivatives of the action: [equation], where the brackets indicate the expectation value with the bounce solution. Since the Faddeev-Popov ghosts do not couple to the Higgs boson with the present choice of the gauge fixing function, [expression], and [equation]. 

\subsection{Functional determinant} 

 

For the evaluation of the functional determinants, we first decompose the fluctuations into partial waves, making use of the [expression] symmetry of the bounce; [equation], where [expression] is the fluctuation operator for each partial wave labeled by non-negative half-integer [expression]. Here, [expression] for fermions, and [expression] for the others.  The explicit form of the fluctuation operators are given in Appendix \ref{apx_determinantJ}. From a theorem [citation], we have [equation], where [expression] and [expression] are sets of independent solutions of [equation], and are regular at [expression]. Notice that, when [expression] is [expression] object, there are [expression] independent solutions that are regular at [expression]. Since [expression] and [expression] obey the same linear differential equations at [expression], the ratio of the two determinant converges for each [expression]. 

With a Fubini-Lipatov instanton, we can calculate the ratio analytically; the details of the calculation are given in Appendix \ref{apx_determinantJ}.  The ratios are given by [equation], with [equation]. Here, [expression] is the gauge coupling constant, and [expression] is the gamma function. 

\subsection{Zero mode} 

In the calculation of the decay rate of the EW vacuum with the present set up, there show up zero modes in association with dilatation, translation, and global transformation of the bounce solution. Consequently, [expression] and [expression] have zero eigenvalues, and their determinants vanish as shown in eqs.\ \eqref{detM^h} and \eqref{detM^gauge}.  A naive inclusion of such results gives a divergent behavior of the decay rate, and hence careful treatments of the zero modes are necessary. 

When there is a zero mode, the saddle point approximation for the path integral breaks down and we need to go back to the original path integral.  Let us consider the path integral for a bosonic field.  We first decompose the fluctuation of the bosonic field (denoted as [expression]) by using the eigenfunctions of the fluctuation operator [expression]: [equation], where [expression] is the expansion coefficient while [expression] obeys [equation], with [expression] being the eigenvalue.  We denote the zero mode as [expression] (and hence [expression]).  In addition, we define  [equation], where the inner product is given by [equation]. We leave [expression]'s unspecified since the final result is independent of them.   

The path integral for a bosonic field [expression] is then defined as [equation], where [expression] denotes the [expression]-dependent terms in the action.  (We take [expression].)  Applying the saddle point approximation for the modes other than the zero mode, the path integral is evaluated as [equation]. Notice that [expression], [expression] and [expression] may depend on [expression] [citation]. 

We are interested in the case where there exists a symmetry and the Lagrangian is invariant under a transformation (parameterized by [expression]). Then, the zero mode is in association with such a symmetry.  In such a case, with the transformation of the bounce solution, [expression] varies as [equation], where the function [expression] is proportional to [expression].  The integration over [expression] can be understood as the integration over the collective coordinate [expression]: [equation]. 

Next, we discuss how we evaluate \begin{align*} \sqrt{\frac{\langle\tilde{\fnc}_0|\tilde{\fnc}_0\rangle}{2\pi}} \prod_{i\neq0}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega_i}}. \end{align*} To omit the zero eigenvalue from the functional determinant, we introduce a regulator to the fluctuation operator: [equation], where [expression] is a small positive number, and [expression] is an arbitrary function that satisfies [equation]. Then, the path integral for the regularized fluctuation operator is given by [equation], resulting in [equation]. The integration in the above expression is nothing but [expression], and can be evaluated with the use of eq.~\eqref{eq_theorem}.  For example, when [expression] is a [expression] object, we have [equation], where [equation], with [expression].  Here, we choose [expression] to be a function of [expression]. 

From Appendix \ref{apx_zeromode}, we have the following replacements to take care of the zero modes: [equation], with [equation]. 



 



 

\subsection{Renormalization} 

After taking the product over [expression], we have a UV divergence and thus we need to renormalize the result.  In this paper, we use the [expression]-scheme for the renormalization. Notice that the counter terms can subtract the divergence even when the background field is position dependent since the counter terms are apparently momentum independent. 

 

Since the dimensional regularization cannot be directly used in this evaluation, we first regularize the result as [equation], where [expression] is a positive number which will be taken to be zero at the end of the calculation. Since the divergence is at most a power of [expression], the sum converges.  In Appendix \ref{apx_infiniteSum}, we calculate the sum analytically, and obtain [equation].  In addition, define [equation]. Then  [equation]. 

 

Next, we relate the above results with those based on dimensional regularizaton in [expression] dimension which contain the regularization parameter [expression] defined as [equation], with [expression] being the Euler's constant.  We convert the results based on two different regularizations by calculating the following quantity: [equation], where [equation], and [expression] is defined similarly. Here, [expression] indicates the expansion up to [expression]. The most important point is that [expression] has the same divergence as [expression] has when [expression] does not have a derivative operator. 

The first line of eq.~\eqref{eq_deltaMExpansion} can be calculated by directly evaluating the traces in a momentum space with using the dimensional regularization; the result is denoted as [expression].  On the other hand, the second line of eq.~\eqref{eq_deltaMExpansion} can be evaluated as [equation], where [equation], for [expression] and [expression], and [expression]. Then, we calculate [equation]. 

We obtain the results based on the dimensional regularization by replacing [equation]. The expressions of [expression] and [expression] for the fields of our interest are given in Appendix \ref{apx_divpart}; the results are converted to those in the dimensional regularization by the following replacements: \begin{itemize} \item for the effect of the scalar field [expression]: [equation]. \item for the Higgs effect: [equation]. \item for the effect of fermions: [equation]. \item for the effect of gauge and NG fields: [equation]. \end{itemize} Subtracting [expression], we get a renormalized prefactor in the [expression]-scheme. 



\subsection{Dilatational zero mode} 

In the calculation of the decay rate of the EW vacuum, we have an integral over [expression] in association with the classical scale invariance, as we saw in eq.~\eqref{eq_dilatationalZeromode}.  So far, we have performed a one-loop calculation of the decay rate, based on which the decay rate behaves as [equation], where [expression] is the one-loop [expression] function of [expression].  The integral does not converge.   

We expect, however, that the integration may converge once higher order effects are properly included.  To see the detail of the path integral over the dilatational zero mode, let us denote the decay rate as [equation], where [expression] fully takes account of all the effects of higher order loops. 

In order to discuss how [expression] should behave, it is instructive to rescale the coordinate variable as [equation], as well as the fields as [equation]. Using the rescaled fields, all the explicit scales disappear from the action as a result of scale invariance: [equation], where [expression] is the total Lagrangian, [equation], and [expression] includes canonically normalized rescaled fields and depends only on the combinations [expression], [expression] and [expression].  In addition, the rescaled bounce solution is given by [equation]. 

Based on [expression] and [expression], we expect: \begin{itemize} \item Only positive powers of [expression], [expression] and [expression] appear in the decay rate since there is no singularity when any of these goes to zero. \item When we renormalize divergences using dimensional regularization, we introduce a renormalization scale [expression]. It is always in a logarithmic function and is related to the original renormalization scale as [equation]. \item In subtracting zero modes associated with transformations of eq.~\eqref{eq_rescaledBounce}, the result should be again a polynomial of [expression], [expression] and [expression]. Notice that, for each zero mode, we have [expression] since eq.~\eqref{eq_dzIntegral} implies [equation]. \item Quantum corrections have [expression] at the [expression]-th loop since the loop expansion is equivalent to the [expression] expansion. \end{itemize} 

Based on the above arguments,  [equation], where [expression] is the contribution at the [expression]-loop level, and [expression] is the number of zero modes. 

If the effects of higher order loops are fully taken into account, [expression] should be independent of [expression] because the decay rate is a physical quantity; in such a case, we may choose any value of the renormalization scale [expression].  In the perturbative calculation, the [expression]-dependence cancells order-by-order [citation]; we can explicitly see the cancellation of the [expression]-dependence at the leading-log level (see eq.\ \eqref{gamma(1-loop)}).  In our calculation so far, however, we only have the one-loop result in which [expression] dependence remains.  As indicated in Eq.\ \eqref{B_eff}, the [expression] dependence shows up in the form of [expression] with [expression], [expression], [expression].  If [expression], the logarithmic term from higher order loops may become comparable to the tree-level bounce action and the perturbative calculation breaks down.  In order to make our one-loop result reliable, we should take [expression].  With such a choice of [expression] (as well as with the use of coupling constants evaluated at the renormalization scale [expression]), the integration over the size of the bounce is dominated by the size with which [expression] becomes the largest.  In particular, in the case of the standard model, the integration over the size of the bounce converges with this prescription as we show in the following section. 

\subsection{Final result} 

Here, we summarize the results obtained in the previous subsections and appendices.  A decay rate with a resummation of the next-to-leading logarithmic terms is given by [equation], where [equation], with [equation]. Here, [expression] is the Glaisher number and [expression] is the volume of the group space generated by the broken generators.  The definitions of [expression], [expression] can be found in Appendix \ref{apx_infiniteSum}.  We emphasize that the final result does not depend on the gauge parameter, [expression], and hence our result is gauge invariant. 

\section{Standard Model} \label{sec_SM} \setcounter{equation}{0} 

\subsection{Decay rate} 

Now, we are at the position to discuss the decay rate of the EW vacuum in the SM.  As we have discussed, the decay of the EW vacuum is induced by the bounce configuration whose mass scale is much higher than the EW scale.  Thus, we approximate the Higgs potential as [equation], where [expression] is the Higgs doublet in the SM and [expression] is the Higgs quartic coupling constant.  [expression] depends on the renormalization scale [expression]; in the SM, [expression] becomes negative when [expression] is above [expression] GeV with the best-fit values of the SM parameters.  In addition, the relevant part of the Yukawa couplings are given by [equation], where [expression] and [expression] are left-handed 3rd generation quark doublet and right-handed anti-top quark, respectively, and [expression] is the top Yukawa coupling constant. 

Assuming that [expression], the bounce solution for the SM is given by [equation], where the function [expression] obeys Eq.\ \eqref{eq_Bounce}, and is given by Eq.\ \eqref{BounceSolution}.  In particular, remember that the bounce solution [expression] contains a free parameter, which we choose [expression], because of the classical scale invariance. 

The results given in the previous section can be easily applied to the case of the SM.  Taking account of the effects of the (physical) Higgs boson, top quark, and weak bosons (as well as NG bosons),\footnote {We checked that the effect of the bottom quark is numerically unimportant.} the decay rate of the EW vacuum in the SM can be written in the following form:\footnote {We checked that the analytic formulas given below give same results as those in [citation], where numerical methods are used to sum over the contributions from each [expression], if we take the same renormalization scale [expression].} [equation]. As we have mentioned, the relevant renormalization scale of the integrand is [expression]; in the following numerical analysis, we take [expression] unless otherwise stated.  If [expression] is positive, there is no bounce solution; the integrand is taken to be zero in such a case.  In addition, in order to be consistent with our procedure neglecting the mass term in the Higgs potential, [expression] should be much larger than the EW scale.  This condition is automatically satisfied in the present analysis because [expression] occurs at the scale much higher than the electorweak scale. 

The Higgs contribution [expression] is given in Eq.\ \eqref{A'^(h)}, while the top-quark contributions is given by [equation], where the factor of [expression] in the right-hand side is the color factor. 

One difference between the case of the [expression] gauge symmetry and the SM case is the volume of the gauge space.  In the SM case, we may expand [expression] around the bounce solution with [expression] as [equation]. Here, [expression] and [expression] are NG bosons absorbed by charged [expression]-bosons while [expression] is that by [expression]-boson.  With the change of [expression], the NG modes are transformed as [equation], where [equation], with the Jacobian being given by [expression].\footnote {One may parameterize the bounce configuration using properly normalized [expression] generator [expression] as  \begin{align*} H|_{\rm bounce} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} e^{i\varphi^a T^a} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \bar\phi(r) \end{pmatrix}, \end{align*} with which [expression] and the volume of the gauge space is [equation]. The final result of the decay rate does not change for such a convention.} The integration over the zero modes in association with the gauge transformation of the bounce solution can be replaced by the  integration over the parameter [expression]: [equation]. Then, following the argument given in Appendix \ref{apx_zeromode}, the gauge contribution is evaluated as [equation], where [expression] is given in Eq.\ \eqref{A'(A,NG)}, and [equation], with [expression] and [expression] being the gauge coupling constants of [expression] and [expression], respectively. 

\subsection{Numerical results} 

Now, let us numerically evaluate the decay rate of the EW vacuum in the SM.\footnote {The analysis is basically the same as in [citation], but we use analytic formulae and a different renormalization scale.} The decay rate of the EW vacuum is very sensitive to the coupling constants in the standard model.  In our numerical analysis, we evaluate them using [citation]: [equation], where [expression] and [expression] are Higgs mass and top mass, respectively, while [expression] is the strong coupling constant.  The [expression] and [expression] gauge coupling constants are evaluated by using [expression] and [expression], where [expression] is the Weinberg angle and [expression] is the fine structure constant.  

First, we show the RG evolution of the SM coupling constants in fig.\ \ref{fig_rge}. We use three-loop beta functions given in [citation]  and the central values for the SM parameters. The black dotted line indicates where [expression] reaches the Planck scale [expression].  We also show the running above the Planck scale, assuming there are no significant corrections from gravity.\footnote { [citation]} For [expression], [expression] becomes negative; for such a region, we use a dashed line to indicate [expression]. 

In order to understand the [expression] dependence of [expression], let us show one-loop RG equations of [expression] and [expression] (although, in our numerical calculation, we use RG equations including two- and three-loop effects): [equation]. At a low energy scale, the term proportional to [expression] drives [expression] to a negative value. As the scale increases, [expression] decreases while [expression] increases, which brings [expression] back to a positive value. Notice that [expression] is bounded from below in the SM. 

\begin{figure}[t] \begin{center} \hspace{0.8ex}\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{rge.eps} \includegraphics[width=0.625\linewidth]{lngam.eps} \end{center} \caption{{\it Top}: The RG evolution of the relevant SM coupling constants as a function of [expression] (with [expression] being in units of [expression]), taking [expression].  The dashed line indicates [expression]. The black dotted line shows the scale where [expression]. The horizontal axis is common with the bottom panel. {\it Bottom}: The integrand of the decay rate. We use the central values for the SM parameters. In the shaded region, [expression] is positive and the integrand is zero.    } \label{fig_rge} \end{figure} 

We show the integrand of [expression] in the bottom panel of fig.\ \ref{fig_rge}, together with that of [equation]. They are also shown in a linear scale in the top panel of fig.\ \ref{fig_dgamma}. 

There are some remarks on the integral over [expression]. \begin{itemize} \item As indicated by the top panel of fig.\ \ref{fig_dgamma}, the integral is dominated by the scale [expression], corresponding to [expression], which is close to the Planck scale.  We may formally perform the [expression]-integration up to the scale where [expression] becomes positive again; result of such an analysis is denoted as [expression].  Otherwise, we may stop the integration at [expression], expecting that the SM breaks down at the Planck scale due to an effect of quantum gravity; we also perform such an calculation terminating the integral at [expression], assuming that the bounce solution is unaffected by the effect of quantum gravity, and the result is denoted as [expression]. 

\item As one can see in the bottom panel of fig.\ref{fig_rge}, there is an artificial divergence of the integrand at [expression].  This is due to a breakdown of perturbative expansion owing to too small [expression], which makes the one-loop effect larger than the tree-level one.  We expect that the effect of such a bounce configuration is unimportant because the bounce action for such a small [expression] is significantly suppressed.  Thus, we exclude such a region from the integration over [expression].  In our numerical calculation, we integrate over [expression] only in the region such that [expression] and [expression] for each [expression], where [expression] is the one-loop contribution to [expression], while [expression] is a contribution from particle [expression].   

\end{itemize} 



By numerically integrating over [expression], we obtain\footnote {If we use [expression] instead of [expression], the decay rate is given by [expression], reproducing the result of [citation].} [equation], where the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th errors are due to the Higgs mass, the top mass, the strong coupling constant, and the renormalization scale, respectively.  (In order to estimate the uncertainty due to the choice of the renormalization scale, we vary the renormalization scale from [expression] to [expression].)  Since [expression], the lifetime of the EW vacuum within our Hubble volume is much longer than the age of the universe.  

\begin{figure}[t] \begin{center} \hspace{1.6ex}\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{gam.eps} \includegraphics[width=0.6485\linewidth]{lnA.eps} \end{center} \caption{{\it Top}: The integrand of the decay rate with the central SM parameters. The solid line corresponds to a result at the one-loop level and the dashed one corresponds to that at the tree level. The horizontal axis is common with the bottom figure. We show [expression] with the vertical dotted line.    {\it Bottom}: The size of each quantum correction. The dashed line corresponds to [expression].}  \label{fig_dgamma} \end{figure} 

In fig.\ \ref{fig_SMconst}, we show the decay rate in [expression] vs.\ [expression] plane.  In the red region, [expression] becomes larger than [expression], which we call unstable region.  In the yellow region, the EW vacuum is metastable, meaning that [expression].  In the green region, the EW vacuum is absolutely stable because [expression] is always positive. The dashed, solid, and dotted lines correspond to [expression], and [expression], respectively. The red contours show [expression], [expression], and [expression] with the central value of [expression].    We also show [expression] [expression] and [expression] constraints on the Higgs mass and the top quark mass with the blue regions, adding their errors in quadrature. 

 

We cut-off the integral at [expression], but it does not change the figure since the maximum is not so far from the Planck scale.\footnote {Even with a lower cut-off such as [expression], the result does not change significantly.} The value of [expression] at the maximum of the integrand ranges from [expression] GeV to [expression] GeV in the figure. 

For comparison, we also perform a ``tree-level'' calculation of the decay rate using eq.~\eqref{eq_treelevel}.  The results are [expression] and [expression].  Thus, the difference between [expression] and [expression] turns out to be rather small.  This is a consequence of an accidental cancellation among the contributions of several fields.  In the bottom panel of fig.\ \ref{fig_dgamma}, we show individual quantum corrections separately, as well as the total one-loop contribution.  We can see that a significant cancellaton among the quantum corrections occurs around [expression].  We have also checked that the unstable region on the [expression] vs.\ [expression] plane shifts upward by [expression] if we use [expression]. 

\begin{figure}[t] \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{sm.eps} \end{center} \caption{The stability of the EW vacuum in the SM with a cut-off of the integration at [expression]. The red region is unstable, the yellow region is meta-stable, and the green region is absolutely stable. The dashed, solid, and dotted lines correspond to [expression], and [expression], respectively. The red contours indicate [expression], and [expression] with the central value of [expression]. The blue circles indicate [expression] and [expression] constraints on the Higgs and the top quark masses, with an assumption of Gaussian distribution for errors.}  \label{fig_SMconst} \end{figure} 

\section{Models with Extra Fermions} \label{sec_extra} \setcounter{equation}{0} 

In this section, we consider extensions of the SM with introducing extra fermions. 

 



We perform the RG analysis of the runnings of coupling constants with including the effects of extra fermions.  We include two-loop effects of extra fermions into the [expression]-functions, which can be calculated using the result in [citation].  We also take account of one-loop threshold corrections due to the extra fermions, which are summarized in Appendix \ref{apx_threshold}.\footnote {If we use the two-loop beta functions instead of three-loop ones in the SM calculation, the difference of [expression] is around 40. Thus, the systematic error of neglecting three-loop effects of the extra fermions is expected to be similar or less.} For the integration over [expression], we follow the procedure in the SM case, as well as the following treatments: \begin{itemize} \item We terminate the integration if any of the coupling constants (in particular, Yukawa coupling constants of extra particles) exceeds [expression] since the RG evolution is not reliable above such a scale.   \item In order to maintain the classical scale invariance at a good accuracy, we require [expression], where [expression] is the mass scale of the new particles. \end{itemize} 

\subsection{Vector-like fermions} 

Here, we consider two examples of vector-like fermions, one is colored vector-like fermions and the other is non-colored ones. For simplicity, we assume that the extra fermions have a Yukawa coupling with the SM Higgs boson.    (We also assume that the mixing between the extra fermions and the SM fermions is negligible.)  Since the additional Yukawa couplings tends to drive [expression] to a negative value, the decay rate of the EW vacuum typically becomes larger than that in the SM. It also shifts higher the scale that minimizes [expression]. 

We first discuss the colored vector-like fermions, having the same SM gauge quantum numbers as left-handed quark doublet and right-handed down quark, as well as their vector-like partners; we add [expression] [expression],  [expression] [expression],  [expression] [expression], and [expression] [expression].  (In the parenthesis, we show the quantum numbers of [expression], [expression], and [expression].)   The Lagrangian is given by [equation], where [expression] is the mass parameter of the extra fermions; for simplicity, we assume that the mass is universal for extra fermions. In addition, [expression] and [expression] are new Yukawa coupling constants.  We take these new parameters real and positive. We set renormalization conditions as [equation]. 

 

The calculation of the decay rate is parallel to the SM case, and the decay rate is given in the following form: [equation], where [expression] and [expression] are effects of the extra fermions on the prefactor: [equation]. 

In fig.\ \ref{fig_VLQ}, we show the contours of the constant decay rate on [expression] vs.\ [expression] plane.  Here, we use the central values of the SM parameters. The meanings of the shading colors are the same as in the SM case. The left and the right panels show the results with and without imposing the condition [expression] in integrating over [expression]. As we can see, the effect of such a cut-off is significant. This is because [expression] at the maximum of the integrand, [expression], may become much larger than the Planck scale in the case with extra fermons, as indicated in the left panel of fig.\ \ref{fig_cutoffVLF}. To illustrate the cut-off dependence of the decay rate, we show the constraint with terminating the integration at [expression] in the left panel (dashed line).  In addition, when [expression] and [expression] are small, we have a region of absolute stability. This is because the addition of colored particles makes the strong coupling constant larger than the SM case. It rapidly drives [expression] to a small value, which makes [expression] always positive. Requiring that the lifetime of the EW vacuum should be longer than the age of the universe, we obtain [expression] for [expression]. 

\begin{figure}[t] \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth} \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{VLQ_C.eps} \end{center} \end{minipage} \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth} \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{VLQ.eps} \end{center} \end{minipage} \caption{The decay rate of the EW vacuum for vector-like quarks with (left) and without (right) the cut-off at the Planck scale. The solid lines show [expression], and [expression]. The dashed line corresponds to the constraint when we stop the integration at [expression].} \label{fig_VLQ} \end{figure} 

The second example is non-colored extra fermions, having the same SM quantum numbers as leptons. We introduce [expression] [expression],  [expression] [expression],  [expression] [expression], and [expression] [expression], and the Lagrangian is given by [equation]. We adopt the following renormalization conditions [equation]. The decay rate of the EW vacuum is given by [equation], where [equation]. 

In fig.\ \ref{fig_VLL}, we show the contours of constant decay rate. Since the extra fermions are not colored, we do not have an absolutely stable parameter region. We observe a larger effect of the cut-off at the Planck scale. This is because [expression] is typically large in a wider parameter space, as indicated in the right panel of fig.\ \ref{fig_cutoffVLF}. 

Requiring that the lifetime of the EW vacuum should be longer than the age of the universe, we obtain [expression] for [expression]. The constraint becomes significantly weaker for larger [expression] owing to the cut-off at the Planck scale. 

\begin{figure}[t] \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth} \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{VLL_C.eps} \end{center} \end{minipage} \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth} \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{VLL.eps} \end{center} \end{minipage} \caption{The same figure as fig.\ \ref{fig_VLQ} but for vector-like leptons.}  \label{fig_VLL} \end{figure} 

\begin{figure}[t] \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth} \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{VLQ_max.eps} \end{center} \end{minipage} \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth} \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{VLL_max.eps} \end{center} \end{minipage} \caption{The value of [expression] at the maximum of the integrand, [expression]. The left panel is for vector-like quarks and the right is for vector-like leptons. The numbers in the legends indicate [expression]. In the gray region, the EW vacuum is absolutely stable.  }  \label{fig_cutoffVLF} \end{figure} 



\subsection{Right-handed neutrino} 

Next, we consider the case with right-handed neutrinos which is responsible for the active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism [citation].  For simplicity, we concentrate on the case where only one mass eigenstate of the right-handed neutrinos, denoted as [expression], strongly couples to the Higgs boson (as well as to the third generation lepton doublet).  Then, the Lagrangian is given by [equation], where, in this subsection, [expression] denotes the third generation lepton doublet. We define [equation]. 

Assuming that, for simplicity, the neutrino Yukawa matrix is diagonal in the mass-basis of right-handed neutrinos, the following effective operator shows up by integrating out [expression]: [equation], with [equation]. One of the active neutrino masses is related to the value of [expression] at the EW scale as [equation], with [expression] is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs boson.  In our numerial calculation, we use the following one-loop RGE [citation] [equation], to estimate the neutrino mass. 

In the SM with right-handed neutrinos, the decay rate of the EW vacuum is evaluated as [equation], where [equation]. In fig.\ \ref{fig_RN}, we show the contour plots of the decay rate. Since it does not have any SM charges, the decay rate goes to the SM value when [expression] goes to zero.  The effect of the cut-off at the Planck scale is again large, which is because of a large [expression] as shown in fig.\ \ref{fig_cutoffRHN}.  The purple solid lines show the left-handed neutrino mass.  Requiring that the decay rate should be smaller than the age of the universe, we obtain [expression] for [expression]. 

\begin{figure}[t] \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth} \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{RHN_C.eps} \end{center} \end{minipage} \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth} \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{RHN.eps} \end{center} \end{minipage} \caption{The same figure as fig.\ \ref{fig_VLQ} but for a right-handed neutrino. We also show lines indicating [expression] eV and [expression] eV with purple solid lines.}  \label{fig_RN} \end{figure} 

\begin{figure}[t] \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{RHN_max.eps} \end{center} \caption{The same figure as fig.\ \ref{fig_cutoffVLF} but for a right-handed neutrino.  }  \label{fig_cutoffRHN} \end{figure} 

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec_conclusion} \setcounter{equation}{0} 

 

In this paper, we have evaluated vacuum decay rates for the SM and various models beyond, with including the complete one-loop corrections and a resummation of next-to-leading logarithmic terms. In particular, we have considered models with extra fermions. Since they typically make the EW vacuum unstable, the constraints on their masses and couplings are phenomenologically important. We have also presented a complete set of analytic formulae, which can be applied to any model that exhibits classical conformality at a high energy scale. Together with Appendix \ref{apx_recipe}, we can evaluate the decay rate almost instantaneously. 

We used a recently developed technique to calculate functional determinants in a gauge sector, which not only gives a prescription to integrate gauge zero modes but also allows us to calculate the determinants analytically. We have obtained a manifestly gauge invariant result, starting with a Lagrangian that includes a gauge parameter. 

To sum up all the effects of bounce solutions with different sizes, one needs to go beyond the one-loop level, otherwise the decay rate would become infinite. To improve the result, we resummed the next-to-leading logarithmic terms using the RG evolution of the couplings. There, we have found that an appropriate renormalization scale for the resummation is given by a typical spacial size of a bounce solution. 

In the calculation of the decay rate in the SM, we have found that the field value of the bounce reaches the Planck scale at where [expression] is maximized. We put a cut-off of the integration so that the field value does not exceed the Planck scale since we expect non-negligible corrections from gravity. Then, the result should be understood as a lower bound on the decay rate. We have obtained [equation], where the errors come from the Higgs mass, the top mass, the strong coupling constant, and the renormalization scale, respectively. The effect of the cut-off is turned out to be smaller than that of the renormalization scale. Since [expression], the lifetime is long enough compared with the age of the universe. 

We have analyzed the decay rate for extensions of the SM with extra fermions; (i) vector-like quarks, (ii) vector-like leptons, and (iii) a right-handed neutrino.  We have obtained a constraint on the parameter space for each model, requiring that the lifetime of the EW vacuum is longer than the age of the universe. The results constrain the Yukawa couplings that are larger than about [expression] if we do not consider the cut-off at the Planck scale. The effect of the cut-off was found to be rather large and the constraints on the Yukawa couplings become weaker, at most, by [expression] after including the cut-off.

\appendix \section{Functional Determinant} \label{apx_determinantJ} \setcounter{equation}{0} 

In this appendix, we present explicit forms of functional determinants for various fields and evaluate them analytically.  For simplicity, we consider the case with [expression] gauge interaction; the charge of the scalar field [expression] responsible for the vacuum instability is taken to be [expression].  The potential of [expression] is given by [equation], with [expression]. 

\subsection{Scalar contribution} 

We consider a real scalar field, [expression], which couples to the Higgs field as [equation], where [expression] is a positive coupling constant.  The contribution to the prefactor is given by [equation]. 

First, we expand [expression] into partial waves; [equation], where [expression] is the hyperspherical function on [expression], and [expression] is a coordinate on [expression]. Here, [expression] is a non-negative half-integer and labels the total angular momentum, and [expression] and [expression] are the azimuthal quantum numbers for the [expression]-spin and the [expression]-spin of [expression], respectively. The Laplacian operator acts on the hyperspherical function as [equation], where [equation]. 

Since the fluctuation operator for partial waves does not depend on [expression] and [expression], we have [expression] degeneracy for each [expression].  Summing up all the contributions, we have [equation], where [equation]. 

Using eq.~\eqref{eq_theorem}, we have [equation], where [equation], with [expression]. Notice that [expression]. 

The exact solution to the above differential equation is given by [equation], where [expression] is the hypergeometric function and [equation]. Taking the limit of [expression], we have [equation]. 

\subsection{Higgs contribution} 

Using the bounce solution given in Eq.\ \eqref{BounceSolution}, the Higgs mode fluctuation is parametrized as [equation]. Then, the Higgs contribution to the prefactor is given by [equation]. The procedure is parallel to the scalar case with replacement [expression]. From eq.~\eqref{eq_scalarDeterminant}, we have [equation]. As we can see, [expression] and [expression] have zero modes, which correspond to the scale invariance and the translational invariance, respectively. 

\subsection{Fermion contribution} 

Let us consider chiral fermions [expression] and [expression] with the following Yukawa term [equation]. 

The contribution to the prefactor is given by [equation]. Using the basis given in [citation], we have [equation], where [equation], and [expression] is obtained by replacement [expression] and [expression]. Here, [expression]. 

Using eq.~\eqref{eq_theorem}, we have [equation], where [equation]. 

Solutions can be decomposed into two functions as [equation], where [equation]. 

For the first solution, we take [equation], where [equation]. Here, [expression] behaves as [equation]. 

For the second solution, we take [equation]. Then, [expression] behaves as [equation]. Using these solutions, we get [equation]. Thus, we have [equation]. 

\subsection{Gauge contribution} 

We consider the contributions from gauge bosons, NG bosons, and the Faddeev-Popov ghosts.  Let us consider the following Lagrangian; [equation], where [expression] is the field strength tensor, and [equation], with [equation]. 

Since the Faddeev-Popov ghosts do not directly couple to the Higgs field, we have [equation]. 

At the one-loop level, [expression] is given by [equation], where [equation]. Here, [expression]. 

 

For the partial wave expansions, we use the following basis; [equation], where [expression]'s are arbitrary independent vectors and [expression] is a fully anti-symmetric tensor.  We have [equation], where [equation]. [equation], and [equation]. 

Solutions can be constructed from [citation]\footnote {The function [expression] in the present analysis corresponds to [expression] in [citation]; such a rescaling makes the formulas simpler.} [equation], where [equation]. There are useful relations as [equation]. 

The first solution is obtained by setting [expression], and [equation]. We get [equation]. 

For the second solution, we set [expression] and [equation], where [equation], with [equation]. It satisfies [equation]. Its asymptotic behavior is given by [equation]. Then, using eqs.~\eqref{eq_relationPositiveJ1}, \eqref{eq_relationPositiveJ2}, and \eqref{eq_relationPositiveJ3}, we have [equation]. 

The last solution can be obtained with [equation]. The asymptotic form of [expression] is given by [equation]. Using eqs.~\eqref{eq_relationPositiveJ1}, \eqref{eq_relationPositiveJ2}, and \eqref{eq_relationPositiveJ3}, we have [equation]. 

As for the solutions around the false vacuum, we have [equation]. 

Using them, we obtain [equation]. 

Meanwhile, the functional determinant for [expression] modes can be obtained by replacing [expression] in eq.~\eqref{eq_scalarDeterminant}. We have [equation]. 

For [expression], we have a similar decomposition of solutions [citation], which is given by [equation], where [equation]. Here, [expression] is a source term, which will be used later. For the moment, [expression]. 

There are useful relations; [equation]. 

The first solution to [expression] is given by [equation]. Meanwhile, another solution can be obtained with [equation]. Integrating eqs.~\eqref{eq_relationZero1} and \eqref{eq_relationZero2}, we get [equation]. 

Using them, we obtain [equation], which is due to the existence of zero modes. 

[equation]. 

In summary, we have [equation], with [equation]. 

\section{Zero Modes} \label{apx_zeromode} \setcounter{equation}{0} 

Here, we discuss the zero modes associated with invariance under dilatation, translation, and global transformation. 

\subsection{Dilatational zero mode} 

In [expression] of the Higgs fluctuation, we have a dilatational zero mode. The dilatational transformation is parametrized by [expression] and is given by [equation], where\footnote{Notice that [expression].} [equation]. 

We regulate the determinant as [equation], where\footnote {A prescription used in [citation] is consistent with our argument, where [expression] is a constant.} [equation]. The ratio of the determinant can be obtained from eq.~\eqref{eq_scalarDeterminant} with replacement [expression]. Expanding with respect to [expression], we have [equation]. Thus, we get [equation]. Here, we take an absolute value since there is a negative mode [citation]. 

\subsection{Translational zero mode} 

In [expression] of the Higgs fluctuation, we have translational zero modes. The translation is parametrized by the center of the bounce, [expression], as [equation], where [equation], with [expression].  Notice that [expression] is given by a linear combination of [expression] and that it has the same normalization as [expression].  We regularize the zero mode as [equation], where [equation]. Then, we have [equation], where [equation], with [equation]. The solution behaves as [equation]. Thus, we obtain [equation], where [expression] is the volume of spacetime. 

\subsection{Gauge zero mode} 

In the [expression] contribution of the gauge field, we have a gauge zero mode [citation].  For the case of the [expression] gauge symmetry, the bounce solution is parameterized as Eq.\ \eqref{???inSec2} with the parameter [expression].  The path integral over the gauge zero mode can be understood as the integration over the variable [expression].   

With the change of [expression], the NG mode transforms as  [equation], where [equation], and [expression] is the Jacobian for the group space integral. For [expression] case, [expression], with which the volume of the [expression] group space is [equation]. Using the equation of motion of the bounce solution, we can show [equation]. 

 

We regularize the zero mode as [equation], with [equation]. 

To evaluate it at the leading order in [expression], we evaluate\footnote{If we do a similar calculation for [expression], we get [expression]. Thus, it is enough to calculate [expression].} [equation]. 

The solution can be obtained by setting [equation], in eq.~\eqref{eq_gauge0zeta}. We can solve [expression] as [equation]. Integrating eqs.~\eqref{eq_relationZero1} and \eqref{eq_relationZero2}, we get [expression]. Its asymptotic form is given by [equation]. Thus, we have [equation]. 

\section{Infinite Sum over Angular Momentum} \label{apx_infiniteSum} \setcounter{equation}{0} 

In this appendix, we execute various infinite sums appearing in the calculation of functional determinants. 

We first evaluate the following sum; [equation]. Here, [expression] is half-integer, and [expression] is a complex number satisfying [equation]. For [expression], the sum converges since [expression] goes to zero much faster than power of [expression]. 

First, we rewrite the log-gamma functions with integrals of digamma functions as [equation], where [expression] is the digamma function. 

Then, we use the following relation; [equation], which is valid for [expression] and [expression].  We get [equation]. Notice that this is verified only in region \eqref{eq_rez}. 

Then, we interchange the two integrals\footnote{This is justified when [equation], and integrate over [expression] first. We get [equation]. Notice that the integral over [expression] does not diverge. 

Since we have regularized the sum, the final result should be finite. Thus, we can take the sum first. We get [equation]. We can see that new poles appear at [expression], but the integral is still convergent for positive [expression]. 

In order to execute the integral over [expression], we use the following relation; [equation]. We get [equation]. 

Interchanging the integrals and integrating over [expression], we get \begin{eqnarray} I_B(z)& = &z\int_0^1dt \left[ \frac{(1+\varepsilon)(z-1+tz\varepsilon-\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon^2} +\frac{(1+\varepsilon)^2(2+\varepsilon)[\psi_{\Gamma}(1+tz-z) -\psi_{\Gamma}(1+tz)]}{\varepsilon^3}\right.\nonumber\\ &&\hspace{10ex}+\frac{2+(3+2z-2tz)\varepsilon +(1+z-tz)^2\varepsilon^2}{(1+tz-z)\varepsilon^3}{}_2F_1 \left( 1,1+tz-z,2+tz-z,\frac{1}{1+\varepsilon} \right)\nonumber\\ &&\hspace{10ex}\left.-\frac{(1+\varepsilon) (2+\varepsilon-2tz\varepsilon+t^2z^2\varepsilon^2)}{(1+tz)\varepsilon^3}{}_2F_1 \left( 1,1+tz,2+tz,\frac{1}{1+\varepsilon} \right) \right], \end{eqnarray} where [expression] is the hypergeometric function. 

Since we do not need higher order terms in [expression], we expand it as \begin{eqnarray} I_B(z)& = &\int_0^1dt \left\{ -\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}z(z+1)-\frac{1}{2\varepsilon}z(z+1)(4+z-2tz) +\frac{\ln\varepsilon}{6}z^2(1+z)(1+2z-6tz+6t^2z)\right.\nonumber\\ &&\hspace{10ex}-z+z^2 \left[ -\frac{53}{36}+t+\frac{1}{6}(1-t)H(tz-z)+\frac{1}{6}tH(tz) \right]\nonumber\\ &&\hspace{10ex}+\frac{z^3}{12}[-7+14t+6(1-t)^2H(tz-z)+6t^2H(tz)]\nonumber\\ &&\hspace{10ex}\left.+\frac{z^4}{9}[-1+3(1-t)t+3(1-t)^3H(tz-z)+3t^3H(tz)] +\mathcal O(\varepsilon) \right\}, \end{eqnarray} where [expression] is the harmonic number. 

Executing the final integral, we obtain \begin{eqnarray} I_B(z)& = &-\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}z(z+1) -\frac{2}{\varepsilon}z(z+1) +\frac{1}{6}z^2(z+1)^2\ln\varepsilon +\mathcal S_B(z)+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon), \end{eqnarray} where \begin{eqnarray} \mathcal S_B(z)& = &\frac{1}{6}z(1+z)(1+2z) \left[ \ln\Gamma(1+z)-\ln\Gamma(1-z) \right]\nonumber\\ &&- \left( z+z^2+\frac{1}{6} \right) \left[ \psi_{\Gamma}^{(-2)}(1+z)+\psi_{\Gamma}^{(-2)}(1-z) \right]\nonumber\\ &&+(1+2z) \left[ \psi_{\Gamma}^{(-3)}(1+z)-\psi_{\Gamma}^{(-3)}(1-z) \right]\nonumber\\ &&-2 \left[ \psi_{\Gamma}^{(-4)}(1+z)+\psi_{\Gamma}^{(-4)}(1-z) \right]\nonumber\\ &&+\frac{1}{6}\gamma_Ez^2(z+1)^2-z-\frac{35}{36}z^2-\frac{z^4}{18}\nonumber\\ &&+\frac{1}{2}\ln 2\pi+2\ln A_G+\frac{\zeta(3)}{2\pi^2}. \end{eqnarray} Here, [expression] is the Glaisher number. 

We can repeat the same procedure for the fermion case, where the summation is given by [equation], for [expression]. 

The result is \begin{eqnarray} I_F(z)& = &-\frac{2}{\varepsilon^2}z^2-\frac{5}{\varepsilon}z^2 +\frac{1}{3}z^2(z^2-2)\ln\varepsilon+\mathcal S_F(z)+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon). \end{eqnarray} \begin{eqnarray} \mathcal S_F(z)& = &\frac{2}{3}z(z^2-1) \left[ \ln\Gamma(1+z)-\ln\Gamma(1-z) \right]\nonumber\\ &&-2 \left( z^2-\frac{1}{3} \right)\left[\psi_{\Gamma}^{(-2)}(1+z)+\psi_{\Gamma}^{(-2)}(1-z) \right]\nonumber\\ &&+4z[\psi_{\Gamma}^{(-3)}(1+z)-\psi_{\Gamma}^{(-3)}(1-z)]\nonumber\\ &&-4[\psi_{\Gamma}^{(-4)}(1+z)+\psi_{\Gamma}^{(-4)}(1-z)]\nonumber\\ &&+\frac{1}{3}z^2(z^2-2)\gamma_E-\frac{z^2}{9}(z^2+31)\nonumber\\ &&+4\ln A_G+\frac{\zeta(3)}{\pi^2}. \end{eqnarray} 

Next, we consider [equation], which is similar to [expression], but [expression] is outside of the valid region. 

Using a similar technique, we have [equation]. Here, we executed the sum first. 

Finally, we consider [equation], which appears in the gauge sector. 

Repeating the same procedure, we have [equation]. 

\section{Renormalization with [expression]-scheme} \label{apx_divpart} \setcounter{equation}{0} 

In this appendix, we relate [expression] to [expression]. 

\subsection{Scalar} 

Let us start with the scalar contribution. We first calculate [expression] with using [expression] as a regulator. The expansion of eq.~\eqref{eq_expansionEachJ} is exactly the same as that with respect to [expression]. Thus, we have [equation], where [expression] is the polygamma function. 

Summing over [expression], we get [equation]. As is expected, it has the same divergences as [expression] has. 

Next, we directly calculate [expression] by using the dimensional regularization. We have [equation], where [expression] is the Fourier transform of the argument, [expression], and [equation]. We get a relation between the two regulators as [equation]. 

\subsection{Higgs} 

The relation for the Higgs contribution can be obtained from eq.~\eqref{eq_ScalarRegulatorRel} with replacement [expression]; [equation]. Notice that the zero modes have nothing to do with the divergence. 

\subsection{Fermion} 

Next, we obtain the relation for the fermion contribution. As discussed in [citation], it is better to expand with respect to [expression]. The expansion in eq.~\eqref{eq_deltaMExpansion} is equivalent to [equation], where [equation], and the hatted operator is obtained by replacement [expression].  From eq.~\eqref{eq_scalarDeterminant}, we have [equation], where [equation]. Together with eq.~\eqref{eq_FermionDeterminant}, we have [equation]. Meanwhile, we can calculate it by using the dimensional regularization; [equation]. Thus, we have [equation]. 

\subsection{Gauge field} 

Finally, we obtain the relation for the gauge contribution.  Since the fluctuation operator \eqref{eq_gaugeFluct} has terms proportional to [expression], the expansion given in eq.~\eqref{eq_deltaMExpansion} is not enough to subtract all the divergences. In principle, one can expand up to [expression], but it is not so efficient. Instead, we use a different gauge fixing function given by [equation], which we call the background gauge. We take [expression] in the following, but we can show that the result does not depend on [expression] [citation]. 

Using the same basis given in eq.~\eqref{eq_gaugeBasis}, we have [equation], and we also have Faddeev-Popov contributions, [equation]. Here, [equation]. [equation]. For the partial waves, we have [equation]. [equation], and [equation]. The hatted operators are defined through replacements [expression] and [expression]. 

A prominent feature of this gauge fixing is that we can take a basis so that [expression] is diagonalized; [equation], where [equation]. Furthermore, the contributions from [expression] and [expression] are exactly canceled out for [expression]. 

Repeating the same procedure using solutions given in [citation], we can show that [equation]. In particular, the structure of the divergence is the same. It means that [equation]. Furthermore, as discussed in [citation], we can show that [equation]. Since the finite part cannot depend on the regularization, we have [equation], where [expression] is defined accordingly to eq.~\eqref{eq_regDiv}. 

Let us evaluate the divergent part with [expression] regularization. Before proceeding, we define the following quantities. [equation], and [equation]. Then, [equation], where [equation]. Notice that [expression], and that the contributions from [expression] and [expression] are canceled out for [expression].  Summing over [expression], we get [equation]. 

On the other hand, we have the result with the dimensional regularization, [equation]. 

Thus, we get [equation]. 

\section{Threshold Corrections} \label{apx_threshold} \setcounter{equation}{0} 

In this appendix, we summarize the one-loop threshold corrections for the models with extra fermions.  All of the threshold corrections in our analysis can be written as [equation], where [expression] is a coupling constant used below the matching scale, while [expression] is that used above the scale.  For the notational simplicity, we will only show the function [expression] for each coupling constant.  The function [expression] also contains the extra fermion mass [expression] and the matching scale [expression], which is equal to [expression] in our analysis. 

\begin{itemize} \item Vector-like quarks [expression] \end{itemize} [equation]. 

\begin{itemize} \item Vector-like leptons [expression] \end{itemize} [equation]. 

\begin{itemize} \item Right-handed neutrino \end{itemize} [equation]. 

\section{Numerical Recipe} \label{apx_recipe} \setcounter{equation}{0} 

In this appendix, we give fitting formulas of the prefactors at the one-loop level.  Contrary to the analytic formulas including various special functions with complex arguments, which may be inconvenient for numerical calculations, the fitting formulas give a simple procedure to perform a numerical calculations of the decay rate with saving computatioal time.  Compared to the analytic expressions, the errors of the fitting formulas are [expression] or better.
